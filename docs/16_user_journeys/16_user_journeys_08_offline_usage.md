# User Journey — Working Offline

This document describes how users **work confidently while offline**.

---

## 1. User Intent

The user wants to:
- Continue reading and annotating
- Trust that nothing will be lost
- Resume seamlessly when online

---

## 2. Offline Capabilities

When offline, users can:
- Read stored content
- Search deterministically
- Create notes and highlights
- Run local AI queries (if models present)

---

## 3. Deferred Actions

The system queues:
- New ingestion requests
- Update checks
- External notifications

---

## 4. Reconnection

When connectivity returns:
- Deferred actions resume
- User is notified of outcomes

---

## Closing Note

Offline mode is a first-class state, not a degraded failure.
