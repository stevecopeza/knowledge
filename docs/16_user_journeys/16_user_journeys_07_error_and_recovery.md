# User Journey — Errors and Recovery

This document describes how users experience **failures and recovery** without losing trust or data.

---

## 1. User Intent

The user wants to:
- Understand when something failed
- Know whether action is required
- Recover safely

---

## 2. Failure Scenarios

Common failures include:
- Ingestion errors
- Partial bulk imports
- AI processing failures

---

## 3. System Response

- Failures are surfaced clearly
- Partial success is preserved
- No silent retries without visibility

---

## 4. User Actions

Users may:
- Retry failed tasks
- Ignore non-critical failures
- Inspect error details

---

## Closing Note

Failure handling prioritises clarity over optimism.
