# User Journey — AI-Assisted Reasoning

This document describes how users **interact with AI safely** through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

## 1. User Intent

The user wants to:
- Ask questions of their knowledge
- Get summaries or synthesis
- Understand where answers come from

---

## 2. Asking a Question

**User action:**
- Enters a question within a defined scope

**System behavior:**
- Selects context based on scope rules
- Retrieves relevant knowledge objects

---

## 3. AI Response

**User sees:**
- A draft answer
- Explicit source references
- Confidence cues, not certainty

---

## 4. Review and Acceptance

The user may:
- Accept the output
- Edit it
- Discard it

AI output never becomes canonical automatically.

---

## 5. When AI Is Wrong

- Errors are expected
- User judgement prevails
- No learning loop alters canonical data

---

## Closing Note

AI assists reasoning; it never replaces it.
