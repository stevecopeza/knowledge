# User Journey — Notes and Highlights

This document describes how users **interact deeply with content** through highlights and notes. These actions represent the transition from information to knowledge.

---

## 1. User Intent

The user wants to:
- Mark important passages
- Attach personal interpretation or questions
- Preserve insight even if sources change

---

## 2. Creating a Highlight

**User action:**
- Selects text within a Version or Fork
- Creates a Highlight

**System behavior:**
- Stores quoted text and positional anchors
- Binds Highlight to a specific Version or Fork

Highlights are precise and durable.

---

## 3. Adding Notes

**User action:**
- Attaches a Note to a Highlight or directly to a Version/Fork

**System behavior:**
- Note is private by default
- Fully searchable

Notes do not alter source content.

---

## 4. Reviewing and Editing

Users can:
- Edit their Notes
- Archive Notes

Edits do not create versions. Original intent is preserved.

---

## 5. Visibility and AI Use

- Private Notes remain private
- Scoped Notes may be used in AI context if permitted

The user always controls exposure.

---

## 6. When Sources Change

If a Version is superseded:
- Highlights persist
- If anchoring degrades, the user is notified

No silent reattachment occurs.

---

## Closing Note

Notes and Highlights are the system’s most valuable artifacts. Automation must never dilute their meaning.
