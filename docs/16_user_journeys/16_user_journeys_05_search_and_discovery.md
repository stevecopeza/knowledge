# User Journey — Search and Discovery

This document describes how users **find knowledge** using deterministic and AI-assisted search.

---

## 1. User Intent

The user wants to:
- Locate relevant knowledge quickly
- Understand why results appear
- Trust that nothing important is hidden

---

## 2. Deterministic Search

**User action:**
- Enters a search query

**System behavior:**
- Searches titles, content, notes, highlights
- Applies permission and scope filters

Results are predictable and repeatable.

---

## 3. Scoped Search

Users may scope search to:
- A Project
- A Category
- The entire repository

Scope is always visible.

---

## 4. Semantic / AI Search

If enabled:
- AI assists ranking or retrieval
- Deterministic results remain available

AI never hides deterministic matches.

---

## 5. Understanding Results

Users can inspect:
- Why a result matched
- Which fields contributed
- Any weighting applied

---

## Closing Note

Search is a trust surface. Surprise is treated as a defect.
