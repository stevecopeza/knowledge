# User Journey — Managing Knowledge with Projects

This document describes how users **organise and research knowledge using Projects**. Projects are treated as research contexts, not folders.

---

## 1. User Intent

The user wants to:
- Focus research on a specific topic
- Group relevant articles, versions, and forks
- Run analysis or AI queries within a bounded scope

---

## 2. Creating a Project

**User action:**
- Navigates to Knowledge → Projects
- Creates a new Project
- Writes a short intent statement

**System behavior:**
- Project is created empty
- No content is duplicated

---

## 3. Adding Knowledge to a Project

Users can:
- Add Articles or Versions to a Project
- Add Forks if reinterpretation is required

Membership is by reference, not ownership.

---

## 4. Working Inside a Project

Within a Project, the user can:
- View all related knowledge
- See research tasks and progress
- Scope search and AI queries

The Project defines context, not hierarchy.

---

## 5. Async Research Tasks

**User action:**
- Triggers a research task (e.g. summarise, analyse)

**System behavior:**
- Task runs asynchronously
- Progress is visible
- Results require human acceptance

---

## 6. Completion and Iteration

Projects may:
- Remain active indefinitely
- Be archived when complete

Archiving a Project does not affect its knowledge.

---

## Closing Note

Projects help users think clearly by constraining scope, not by hiding information.
