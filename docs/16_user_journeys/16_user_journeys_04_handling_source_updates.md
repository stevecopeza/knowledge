# User Journey — Handling Source Updates

This document describes how users experience **updates to previously ingested sources**. This journey is critical to trust and transparency.

---

## 1. User Intent

The user wants to:
- Be aware when a source has changed
- Decide what to do with the change
- Preserve prior understanding and annotations

---

## 2. Update Detection

**System behavior:**
- Periodic or manual recrawl detects change
- A new Version is created
- Existing Version is marked Superseded

No content is overwritten.

---

## 3. User Notification

**User sees:**
- A clear notification that a source has changed
- Summary of what changed

No automatic acceptance occurs.

---

## 4. User Choices

The user may:
- Accept the new Version
- Ignore the update
- Fork the new Version

Each choice is explicit.

---

## 5. Impact on Notes and Highlights

- Existing annotations remain bound to the original Version
- No silent migration occurs
- User may manually re-anchor if desired

---

## Closing Note

Source updates are moments of decision, not automation.
