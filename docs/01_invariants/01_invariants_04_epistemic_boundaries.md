# Epistemic Boundaries

This document defines the **epistemic boundaries** of the Knowledge system. It clarifies what the system claims, what it deliberately does not claim, and where authority resides.

These boundaries are **non-negotiable invariants**. Any feature that violates them is invalid by definition.

---

## 1. Truth vs Usefulness

The Knowledge system does **not** determine objective truth.

Instead, it manages:
- Provenance
- Context
- Interpretation
- Usefulness within a defined scope

Content stored in the system may be:
- Incomplete
- Biased
- Incorrect

The system’s responsibility is to **preserve and surface context**, not to adjudicate correctness.

---

## 2. Human Authority

Humans are the sole authoritative agents in the system.

This means:
- Only humans can accept summaries
- Only humans can score or rate content
- Only humans can promote forks or versions

No automated process may silently:
- Override human judgement
- Modify canonical knowledge
- Reinterpret intent

---

## 3. AI Authority Limits

AI systems are treated as **non-authoritative assistants**.

AI may:
- Summarise content
- Surface connections
- Assist with retrieval

AI may not:
- Assert truth
- Resolve disagreements
- Promote or demote knowledge objects
- Operate without explicit scope

All AI output is:
- Draft by default
- Reviewable
- Discardable

---

## 4. Scoring Intent

Scores represent **contextual human judgement**, not factual correctness.

Scoring is used to express:
- Relevance to a Project
- Perceived credibility within a Category
- Usefulness for a given purpose

Scores must not be interpreted as:
- Truth indicators
- Consensus measures
- Algorithmic rankings of reality

---

## 5. Explainability as a Boundary

Any system behaviour that influences:
- Search ranking
- Retrieval weighting
- AI context selection

Must be explainable in human terms.

Opaque inference violates epistemic boundaries.

---

## Closing Invariant

The Knowledge system exists to **support human reasoning**, not to replace it.

If a feature improves automation at the cost of human authority, it must be rejected.

These boundaries override convenience, performance, and novelty.
