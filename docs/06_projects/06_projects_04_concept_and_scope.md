# Projects — Concept and Scope

## Definition
A Project is a **research context**, not a folder.

Projects define:
- Intent
- Scope
- Boundaries for search and AI

They do not own content.

## What Projects Are
- A curated set of Articles, Versions, Forks, and Notes
- A lens through which knowledge is viewed and reasoned over

## What Projects Are Not
- Storage containers
- Taxonomies
- Publishing units

---

## Core Principle
Removing a Project never deletes knowledge.
