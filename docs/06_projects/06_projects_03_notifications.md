# Projects — Notifications

This document defines how **notifications** are generated, scoped, and delivered for Project-related activity. Notifications exist to inform, not to distract.

---

## 1. Notification Triggers

Notifications may be generated for:
- Task completion
- Task failure
- Project milestones
- Source updates within a Project

---

## 2. Scope and Audience

Notifications are scoped by:
- Project
- User role

Users receive only notifications relevant to their permissions.

---

## 3. Delivery Channels

Initial delivery is via:
- WordPress admin notifications

Future channels may include:
- Email
- Webhooks

---

## 4. Configuration

Users may configure:
- Which events generate notifications
- Delivery frequency

Defaults are conservative.

---

## Closing Note

Notifications are part of operational trust. Over-notification is treated as a failure mode.
