# MVP Cut — Phase 2 and Phase 3

This document defines **explicitly deferred capabilities** and longer-horizon expansions. Inclusion here indicates *design awareness*, not commitment.

---

## Phase 2 — Expansion (Post-MVP)

Phase 2 focuses on **depth and ergonomics**, not new paradigms.

### 1. Enhanced Scoring & Assessment
- Category-specific scoring templates
- Reviewer role workflows
- Comparative views across sources

---

### 2. Semantic Search Improvements
- Tunable embedding strategies
- Hybrid deterministic + semantic ranking
- Cross-project semantic queries

---

### 3. Project Intelligence
- Automated contradiction detection
- Project-level synthesis summaries
- Research timelines

---

### 4. Client Tooling
- Browser extensions
- Mobile capture apps
- Offline-first client sync

---

## Phase 3 — Long-Horizon (Optional)

Phase 3 introduces **new interaction models**, with higher risk.

### 1. Advanced Explainability
- Answer provenance graphs
- Confidence visualisation

---

### 2. Visual Knowledge
- Deeper image understanding
- Diagram-aware reasoning

---

### 3. Governance at Scale
- Multi-organisation tenancy
- Compliance exports
- Policy enforcement

---

## Explicit Non-Commitments

The following are acknowledged but not planned:
- Social discovery
- Public publishing
- Algorithmic content curation

---

## Closing Note

Phases define *possibility*, not obligation. Progression requires explicit reassessment against the Design Invariants.
