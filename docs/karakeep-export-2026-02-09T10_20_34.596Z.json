It does not appear that there is anything [or much] on AI or automation, on the agenda. The event is also proceeding after the recent situation of job numbers and the BLS.\n\nIt is possible that they had discussed AI and automation in past years. It is possible they also want to tamper AI fears, but what are the new models in labor economics to prepare for AI’s coming sweep? Universal basic income [UBI] is an option but it does not hold thorough promise. Profit-sharing from AI revenues may also be an option as some have discussed, but the questions are, what jobs may “guarantee retirement income, health insurance and a decent living” if AI replaces people?\n\nWill labour economics manage AI and Automation?\n\nThis is the key question that should be consuming serious labor economics research at this time. Some people might say, if AI solves problems, it could bring healthcare costs down, but there is no guarantee that AI or AGI would do so. Also, retirement, decent living, something to do and so on are questions that necessitates urgency in labor economics research.\n\nHealthcare\n\nA simple permutation is that wherever AI cuts costs in healthcare could become a-subsidized-to-free cost for people. It could be explored with some social assistance programs or with insurance, but mostly ways that AI can shape better health, ensuring that costs remain for what AI can’t fix.\n\nAlso, it is possible to explore other cost-cutting modes, with generic drugs, assistant physicians, facilities sharing, conceptual brain science and so forth. Those with the jobs left can pay higher premiums and AI companies, with all the profits, can support the system maybe. People who were let go in other areas can also get trained for health roles, somewhat, within possibility.\n\nRetirement\n\nAs AI shows up, the model of retirement may become anachronistic. People may never have to retire or only have to retire when absolutely incapacitated. There can be tier-based jobs, where hours are capped and income is below minimum wage, but everyone would have to contribute — wherever required — to something in the economy.\n\nThere can also be new non-monetary taxation, as well as reserves of products and services not just currency or precious metals. These reserves can also become new exchange standards outside fiat.\n\nLabor Economics\n\nAI would get work done, a lot of work. New structures for work in labor models must emerge to sustain human society, while preventing more inequities and other flaws.\n\nThere is a recent [August 13, 2025] insight by Goldman Sachs, How Will AI Affect the Global Workforce?, stating that, “Recent commentary by some public companies suggests the labor market is already experiencing effects related to AI. Executives from the technology and finance sectors say they are seeing efficiency gains from generative AI that are sufficient to slow their hiring, especially in operational and back-office capacities.”\n\n“That said, AI adoption remains relatively low, especially among midsized and small enterprises. While adoption rates have accelerated recently, the vast majority of companies have not incorporated AI into regular workflows. In a recent US survey, only 9.3% of companies reported that they had used generative AI in production during the last two weeks.”\n\n“To date, low adoption is limiting the overall labor-market impacts from AI, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our economists found no significant statistical correlation between AI exposure and a host of economic measures, including job growth, unemployment rates, job finding rates, layoff rates, growth in weekly hours, or average hourly earnings growth.”\n\nDavid Stephen currently does research in conceptual brain science with focus on the electrical and chemical configurators for how they mechanize the human mind with implications for mental health, disorders, neurotechnology, consciousness, learning, artificial intelligence and nurture. He was a visiting scholar in medical entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, IL. He did computer vision research at Rovira i Virgili University, Tarragona."},"note":null,"archived":false},{"createdAt":1755609116,"title":"Claude Code Designer Agent : Your Coding Assistant Just Became a UI Design Pro","tags":["UI Design","Code Automation","Automated Testing","Front-end development"],"content":{"type":"link","url":"https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/claude-code-designer-agent-your-coding-assistant-just-became-a-ui-design-pro/?utm_source=flipboard&utm_content=topic%2Ftechnology"},"note":null,"archived":false},{"createdAt":1755606691,"title":"AI isn’t just replacing tasks.

To allow connections from other machines or networks, you need to configure Ollama to listen on a different address, like 0.0.0.0 or your specific IP address. This is typically done by modifying the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable. \nHere's how to configure Ollama to accept connections from other locations: \nEdit the Ollama service file:\nOpen the ollama.service file using sudo systemctl edit ollama.service. This will open an editor with the service's override file.\nAdd the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable:\nIn the editor, add the following line within the [Service] section:\nCode\n\n     [Service]\n     Environment=\"OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434\"\n0.0.0.0 means Ollama will listen on all available IP addresses on the machine. You can also specify a specific IP address if needed. \n11434 is the default port for Ollama. \n1. Reload and restart the service:\nSave the changes to the override file.\nReload the systemd configuration: sudo systemctl daemon-reload\nRestart the Ollama service: sudo systemctl restart ollama\n2. Verify the change:\nUse ss -tuln | grep 11434 to check which addresses Ollama is listening on. You should see *:11434 or your specific IP address and port.\n3. Client-side configuration (if needed):\nIf you are using a client (e.g., a web UI, a script) that is making the API calls, you might need to update the client to point to the new address. For example, if you are using Open WebUI, you might need to use the --network=host flag in your Docker command or update the URL in your client configuration to use the machine's IP address instead of localhost. \n4. Proxy considerations:\nIf you are using a proxy, ensure that it is configured to forward requests to the Ollama server's new address. You might need to add the Ollama server's address to the no_proxy environment variable to bypass the proxy for local connections. \nBy following these steps, you can configure Ollama to accept API connections from any machine on the network or from specific IP addresses, enabling you to use it with different clients or in a distributed setup."},"note":null,"archived":false},{"createdAt":1752927903,"title":"GitHub -
