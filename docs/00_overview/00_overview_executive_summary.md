# Knowledge System — Executive Summary (1 Page)

## What This Is

The Knowledge system is a **local-first, ownership-first knowledge repository** implemented as a WordPress plugin. It is designed for people and organisations who need to **retain, analyse, and reason over information long-term**, without losing trust, provenance, or control to external platforms or opaque AI systems.

It treats knowledge as **durable infrastructure**, not as disposable notes or feeds.

---

## The Problem

Most modern knowledge tools fail in predictable ways:

- Information is scattered across services and links
- External content changes or disappears without notice
- Notes become detached from their original sources
- AI tools generate answers without traceability
- Convenience is prioritised over correctness

The result is fragile knowledge that cannot be trusted over time.

---

## The Solution

The Knowledge system solves this by:

- Capturing content once and storing it **locally and permanently**
- Preserving **immutable versions** of sources
- Allowing controlled divergence via **forks**, not silent edits
- Treating annotations (highlights, notes, discussions) as first-class data
- Using AI strictly as an **assistive, non-authoritative consumer**
- Remaining fully usable **offline**

---

## Core Concepts (Plain English)

- **Articles**: Logical knowledge items
- **Versions**: Immutable snapshots of source content
- **Forks**: User-controlled edits with preserved lineage
- **Projects**: Research contexts that group knowledge and scope AI
- **Annotations**: Durable human insight bound to specific text

---

## How It Works (High Level)

1. Content is ingested from URLs, documents, or APIs
2. Content and media are stored locally
3. Users annotate and organise knowledge
4. Deterministic search is always available
5. AI reasoning (RAG) operates over explicit, explainable scope

Nothing is silently changed. Nothing is owned by AI. Nothing depends on the cloud.

---

## What Makes It Different

- Not a note-taking app
- Not a social platform
- Not an AI agent
- Not a publishing system

It optimises for **trust, longevity, and explainability**, even at the cost of speed or novelty.

---

## Who It’s For

- Individuals who care about durable personal knowledge
- Teams doing research or analysis
- Organisations with ownership, audit, or offline requirements

---

## Bottom Line

This system is intentionally conservative. If a feature improves speed but reduces trust, it is rejected.

That trade-off is deliberate.
