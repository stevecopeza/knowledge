# Annotation — Notes

This document defines how **Notes** function as user-authored annotations within the knowledge system. Notes capture interpretation, commentary, and analysis.

---

## 1. Purpose

Notes allow users to attach meaning, questions, and insights to specific knowledge contexts.

They are:
- Human-authored
- Contextual
- Searchable

---

## 2. Attachment Rules

A Note must attach to exactly one of:
- A Highlight
- A Version
- A Fork

Notes do not exist independently.

---

## 3. Visibility Defaults

- Notes are **private by default**
- Visibility may be expanded explicitly

Visibility scopes:
- Private (author only)
- Project-scoped
- Repository-scoped

---

## 4. Edit and Archive

- Notes are editable by their author
- Edits do not create new versions
- Notes may be archived but not deleted by default

---

## 5. Search and AI Exposure

- Notes are indexed for deterministic search
- Notes may be included in AI context based on permissions

Rules:
- Private notes are never exposed to AI outside their scope

---

## Closing Note

Notes represent human judgement. Automation must never rewrite or reinterpret them.
